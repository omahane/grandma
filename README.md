# Grandma's story

Turned 93 on 22 April 2022.

Born 22 April 1929. 

Her earliest memory is of a cold night with her mother. They are entering the house from the back door and she looked up into the black sky with its many pinpoints of light dotting the vast field of black. She said aloud, "The sky has pimples," and her mother laughed.

She was a self-described "loner," who preferred the company of her bike and the long roads from LaSalle to Starved Rock to that of her peers.
