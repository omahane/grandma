# Grandma's story

Turned 93 on 22 April 2022.

Born 22 April 1929. 

A clock factory worker, shipping clerk, punch press operator, wife, mother, grandmother, realtor, tax preparer, great grandmother and author, 

She worked as an assistant to her father delivering milk, at the Westclox factory, at Wille Brothers as a shipping clerk and punch press operator, a realtor and tax preparer. She also had a life of hobbies and unpaid work, starting with taking long bike rides, target shooting, sewing, doting on her many dogs, supporting the PTA, and singing, the activity that gave her the most joy.

Her life was one controlled by men, from her father to her husbands. Like Mary and her lab, Rosemary Koensgen (sp) had a dog that would follow her to school. It would wait for her during class and play with her and her friends at recess. At the end of the school day, it would walk her home. One day, a boy in the neighborhood teased the dog until it chased him. His parents called the police who told the mother they had to shoot the dog. Instead, her mother chased them out the door with a broom. 



Her earliest memory is of a cold night with her mother. They are entering the house from the back door and she looked up into the black sky with its many pinpoints of light dotting the vast field of black. She said aloud, "The sky has pimples," and her mother laughed.

She was a self-described "loner," who preferred the company of her bike and the long roads from LaSalle to Starved Rock to that of her peers.

Her mother died of breast cancer when Rosemary was 15. Rosemary would visit her after school. 

After high school, she moved to Blue Island, Illinois. She found a job at Willie Brothers (sp), first as a shipping clerk, later on the punch press. This is where she met Daniel Servello, who, as a foreman, told the owner to fire her. Eventually, she learned to work the press and was producing 50% more than her peers (citation needed). After work, she and Daniel would walk home together, talking the whole way, occasionally stopping to have a drink. He was 20 years older, but she did not mind. He was a hard worker, honest and good looking. They married.
